Title: Zero Trust Core Principles
Content:
- Verify explicitly: identity, device, location, behavior, risk.
- Least privilege: JIT/JEA, role- and attribute-based access.
- Assume breach: segment, egress control, encrypt everywhere.
- Continuous evaluation: every request/session, not one-time login.
- Policy-as-code: versioned, tested, automated enforcement.
- Telemetry-driven: measure, learn, adapt in near real time.
Slide Design: Three-column tiles with concise statements and small iconography per principle.
Imagery: Minimal icon set (shield, key, segment grid, loop, code bracket, graph) in a consistent line style.

Title: Reference Architecture (Identity, Device, Network, App, Data)
Content:
Pillars
- Identity: Central IdP (SSO), phishing-resistant MFA; Risk-based auth, conditional access; Privileged Access Management (JIT/JEA)
- Device: UEM/MDM enrollment, EDR posture; Cert-based device identity, OS attestation; Compliance gates (encryption, patch, jailbroken)
- Network: ZTNA/SDP for user-to-app; Microsegmentation for east-west; NAC at campus/branch; egress controls
- Application: Service identity & mTLS (mesh/API gateway); OPA/XACML for authZ in apps/APIs; CIAM for external users
- Data: Classification & labeling; Encryption (KMS/HSM), tokenization; DLP & data access governance

Title: Exemplar Policies (Human-Readable)
Content (Policy Snippets):
- Name: User-to-App Access

  * Enforcement Point: IdP + ZTNA

  * Rule: Admins require JIT elevation (2h) with ticket ID; hardware key + re-auth; full session logging.
  * Enforcement Point: PAM + IdP
- Name: Device Posture Gate
  * Rule: Block if OS patch age > 14 days OR encryption off OR EDR inactive; allow ‘limited mode’ to remediation portal.
  * Enforcement Point: UEM/MDM + ZTNA/NAC
- Name: Microsegmentation
  * Rule: Deny east-west between Dev and Prod; allow only via API gateway with service identity and mTLS.
  * Enforcement Point: SDN/Firewall + API Gateway/Service Mesh
- Name: Data Exfiltration
  * Rule: If label=Restricted, prevent external sharing; require encryption; block uploads to unsanctioned domains.
  * Enforcement Point: CASB/SWG + SaaS DLP
- Name: Third-Party Access
  * Rule: Contractors allowed only to assigned apps from approved countries on managed or attested devices; no Tier-0.

Title: Common Pitfalls (and Fixes)
Content:
- Tech-first, identity-later → Fix: start with IdP hygiene, MFA, group/attribute cleanup.
- Lifting VPN into ZTNA 1:1 → Fix: app-by-app access modeled on user/task, not subnets.
- Overlooking device posture → Fix: gate access on UEM/EDR compliance; give remediate path.
- Ignoring legacy apps → Fix: front with ZTNA + header-based auth or app proxies; plan modernization.
- Static exceptions that never expire → Fix: time-bound approvals with owner and review cadence.
- No data classification → Fix: minimal 3-tier labels; automate labeling in pipelines and SaaS.
- Under-measured outcomes → Fix: define KPIs/SLOs; instrument PEPs; weekly review.
- Poor change comms → Fix: UX-first pilots, in-product prompts, helpdesk runbooks/training.
Slide Design: Two-column list with ‘pitfall -> fix’ arrows; concise phrasing.
Imagery: Caution icons next to pitfalls; checkmarks next to fixes; muted background warning stripe.
