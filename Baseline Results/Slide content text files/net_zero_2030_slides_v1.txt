    - 4 × 3 MW electric boilers (steam/hot water)
    - 6 × 1.2 MW industrial heat pumps (COP 2.5–3.0) for low-temp processes
    - 3 × electric IR/convective ovens (1.5–2 MW each) with zonal control
    - Thermal storage (4 MWhth) for load shifting
  Phasing:
    - 2024–2025: FEED studies, pilots on one dryer line, utility interconnection upgrades
    - 2026–2027: Phase 1 install (2 boilers, 3 heat pumps), controls tuning
