Slide 5
Title: How CRISPR Works
Content:
• Diagram Layers
  - Target selection: Cas9 scans DNA for a PAM (e.g., NGG) and the 20‑nt guide RNA (gRNA) base‑pairs with the protospacer.
  - Cutting: Cas9’s HNH and RuvC domains cleave opposite strands to create a double‑strand break (DSB).
  - Repair path A—NHEJ: Error‑prone repair introduces small indels, often yielding gene knockout.
  - Repair path B—HDR: With a donor template, precise edits/insertions are made at the break site.

• Editor Variants
  - Base editors (ABE/CBE): nCas9 or dCas9 fused to a deaminase; single‑base conversions (A↔G, C↔T) without DSB.
  - Prime editor: nCas9 fused to reverse transcriptase with a pegRNA; installs small insertions/deletions/substitutions with minimal cutting.

• Glossary
  - gRNA: Guide RNA that directs the nuclease to a matching DNA sequence
  - PAM: Protospacer Adjacent Motif required for nuclease binding (e.g., NGG for SpCas9)
  - RNP: Ribonucleoprotein complex of Cas protein and gRNA, used for transient editing

Title: Delivery Modalities: Getting Editors to Cells
Content:
• AAV
  - Works best for: In vivo editing in tissues with suitable serotypes (e.g., eye, muscle, CNS subtypes)
  - Pros: Strong tropism and transduction; single‑dose potential; long‑term expression (for some applications)
  - Constraints: Capsid size limits (~4.7 kb) constrain editor payloads; pre‑existing immunity/re‑dosing challenges; potential for vector integration and liver toxicity at high doses
  - Notables: EDIT‑101 (AAV5) for LCA10; Dual‑AAV or compact nucleases (SaCas9) mitigate payload limits

• LNP
  - Works best for: In vivo delivery to liver; expanding to extrahepatic targets via ligand/capsid engineering
  - Pros: Transient expression reduces prolonged exposure risk; manufacturable at scale; modular chemistry; amenable to repeat dosing in some contexts
  - Constraints: Hepatocyte bias limits tropism; infusion‑related reactions; dose ceiling considerations; endosomal escape efficiency is a key bottleneck
  - Notables: NTLA‑2001 (Cas9 mRNA + gRNA LNP) for ATTR; VERVE‑101 (ABE mRNA + gRNA LNP) for PCSK9

• Electroporation (ex vivo)
  - Works best for: Autologous/allogeneic cell therapies (HSPCs, T cells, NK cells)
  - Pros: Transient RNP delivery—minimal off‑target window; high editing rates and multiplex capability; no viral DNA integration
  - Constraints: Manufacturing complexity and cost; conditioning regimens for reinfusion (e.g., myeloablation); logistics of cell collection and release testing
  - Notables: Exa‑cel/CASGEVY (BCL11A enhancer edit) for SCD/TDT; multiplex‑edited allogeneic CAR‑T programs

• Non‑viral/Other
  - Works best for: Emerging systemic/extracellular targets; specialized tissues
  - Pros: Potential for targeted delivery with ligands/antibodies; avoids viral immunity concerns
  - Constraints: Lower transfection efficiency historically; formulation stability and biodistribution challenges
  - Notables: Virus‑like particles (VLPs); polymeric/ionizable lipid hybrids; physical methods (hydrodynamic, microinjection for ocular)
